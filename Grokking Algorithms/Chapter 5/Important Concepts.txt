What are the factors that affecrs the performace of the Hash Table?

1. Load Factor of A Hash Table: the ratio between the number of items per the total slots in the array.
	note that, when the number of items grows (A good rule of thumb is, resize when your load factor is
	greater than 0.7) we need to  resize the array (most of the time doupling the array size) then 
	reinserting the items into the new hash.


2. Hash Function: a good hash function distributes the values evenly over the array. A bad hash function
	groups values together and produces a lot of collisions. the type of hashing algorithm is not usually
	your concern but usually you should use the SHA algorithm.
