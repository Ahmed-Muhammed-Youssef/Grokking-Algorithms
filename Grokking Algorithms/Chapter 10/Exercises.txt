10.1 normalization. You look at the average rating for each person and use it to 
scale their ratings. For example, you might notice that Pinky’s average rating is
3, whereas Yogi’s average rating is 3.5. So you bump up Pinky’s ratings a little,
until her average rating is 3.5 as well. Then you can compare their ratings on the 
same scale.


10.2 You could give more weight to the ratings of the influencers when using KNN.
Suppose you have three neighbors: Joe, Dave, and Wes Anderson (an influencer). 
They rated Caddyshack a 3, a 4, and a 5, respectively. Instead of just taking the 
average of their ratings (3 + 4 + 5 / 3 = 4 stars), you could give Wes Anderson’s
rating more weight: 3 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 5 / 5 = 4.4 stars.


10.3 It's too low for a platform with many users It can easily mess up, the rule of
thumb is if you have N users you should user sqrt(N).
