2.1 linked list

2.2 linked list

2.3 array

2.4 it would take O(n) to insert a new user because of the shifting, if there's no spare contegious memory
the whole memory will be copied to other locations which makes it slower.

2.5 searching: the hypride data structure would be faster than linked list but slower than array.
	insertion: the hypride data structure would be faster than arrays and as fast as linked lists.
